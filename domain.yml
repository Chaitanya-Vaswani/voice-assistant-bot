      Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936 in the depths of the Great
      Depression. This invented modern MACROECONOMICS. It argued that economies could

      but that a GOVERNMENT could remedy this under-employment problem by increasing
      PUBLIC SPENDING and/or reducing TAXATION, thereby increasing the level of aggregate
      DEMAND in the economy. Many politicians picked up on these ideas. As President

      involved. A low Herfindahl indicated many competitors and thus great difficulty
      in exercising MARKET POWER; a high Herfindahl, however, suggested a concentrated
      market in which PRICE rises are easier to sustain. More recently, antitrust
      authorities have placed less emphasis on concentration. One reason is that it
      is hard to define the market in which concentration should be measured. Instead,
